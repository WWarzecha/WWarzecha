## Hi there! 👋

### About me
- I'm Wiktor, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at AGH University Of Krakow 🎓
- I love programming, solving problems, and sometimes even creating them—just to keep things interesting 🙈.
- In my free time, I work on DIY projects 🔧, hit the gym 🏋️, and dive into both my current hobbies and new ones 🌱.

### Achievments
- *Winner of the SWM Hackathon 2024* with project Krakoskie-Obwarzanki (webapp to track current locations of pretzel shops) 🥨
- Successfully made it through over 2 years of studying computer science without losing my sanity (yet) 🤪
